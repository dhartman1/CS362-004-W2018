Bug #1:
    Title: Dominion - smithy_effect card drawing bug

    Class: Serious Bug

    Date: 2018-03-01
    Reported By: David Hartman
    Email: hartmand@oregonstate.edu

    Product: Alvin Le's Dominion
    Platform: Windows Subsystem for Linux - Ubuntu

    Is it reproducible: Yes

    Description
    ===========
    When playing the Smithy card in the dominion game an incorrect number of
    cards are drawn into the current player's hand. This bug occurs every time
    the Smithy card is played.

    Steps to Produce/Reproduce
    --------------------------
    In the following code, smithyPos is the position of the Smithy card in the
    current player's hand and state is a pointer to the game state.

        playCard(smithyPos, 0, 0, 0, state);

    Expected Results
    ----------------
    Since the Smithy card is discarded when played (hand count loses 1) and the
    Smithy card causes 3 cards to be drawn (hand count gains 3), I expected a
    net gain of 2 cards to the players hand.

    Actual Results
    --------------
    There were 2 cards drawn into the hand and 1 card was discarded. Therefore
    the player's hand resulted in a net gain of 1 card.

Bug #2:
    Title: Dominion - village_effect numActions bug

    Class: Serious Bug

    Date: 2018-03-01
    Reported By: David Hartman
    Email: hartmand@oregonstate.edu

    Product: Alvin Le's Dominion
    Platform: Windows Subsystem for Linux - Ubuntu

    Is it reproducible: Yes

    Description
    ===========
    When playing the Village card in the dominion game there are unexpected
    effects on the player's numActions. This bug occurs every time the Village
    card is played.

    Steps to Produce/Reproduce
    --------------------------
    In the following code, villagePos is the position of the Village card in the
    current player's hand and state is a pointer to the game state.

        playCard(villagePos, 0, 0, 0, state);

    Expected Results
    ----------------
    In order for a player to play a card, they must have at least 1 action
    available. This is no different for the Village card. One of the effects of
    the Village card is that the player will gain 2 additional actions that
    turn. With both of these statements, the net gain of actions for a player
    should be 1. The following table shows the ending numActions for various
    starting numActions.

     Starting numActions | Ending numActions (+2 -1)
    ---------------------+---------------------------
                       1 |                         2
                       2 |                         3
                       3 |                         4
                       4 |                         5

    Actual Results
    --------------
    Instead of increasing the number of actions by 2 and then removing 1 for
    playing the Village card, the program sets the number of actions to 2 and
    then removes one for playing the Village card. This results in 1 available
    action for the player no matter how many they started with. The following
    table shows what actually happens to numActions for various starting
    numActions.

    Starting numActions | Ending numActions (=2 -1)
   ---------------------+---------------------------
                      1 |                         1
                      2 |                         1
                      3 |                         1
                      4 |                         1
